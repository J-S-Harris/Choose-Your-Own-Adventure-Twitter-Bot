An interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style, game/narrative experience.
Mention the bot along with your next step, and the bot will respond, setting the scene, and telling you the possible next steps.
The bot will support many multiple players when it is live.
It is mainly written in Python, and it uses a SQL database and Twitter's API to track and respond to players' decisions.
Currently very much a WIP at the moment, though I hope to make rapid progress in the coming days.
